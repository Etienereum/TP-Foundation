# Programming Exercises:
1.
Write a python script in which you implement a function with an 3D 10x10x10 python array. Fill that array with the first 1000 prime numbers. Make the order random (non-consecutive). Return the filled array and print it in the console.

2.
Use the python library pandas to import some klines from any open API you can find and save them into a pandas dataframe. Print out the first 5 rows and the last 5 rows of the dataframe. Do not send us your private API key.

3.
Write a python script that generates a block from a blockchain. A sample .json file can be found on our github at https://github.com/tygerprotocol/tp-test/ . Recreate this file with random values for adresses and amount for example. Just send the python script. We will check the resulting file output ourselves.
